## Pulse Faculty Data Scraper 

Just a rewrite of what I wrote in python, fetches data from the API used by the macrec website (found out about the API from the js files of the website).

Didn't bother to create embeds yet, but the goal was to write code in rust and use asynchronous functions. I'll add tests and CI/CD stuff when exams are over!

Performance gains? Of course
Rust is my go to language now!
